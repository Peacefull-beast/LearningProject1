***Deep Learning Image Classification Project***

**Overview**
- This deep learning image classification project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project focuses on building a custom CNN model from scratch to classify a diverse dataset consisting of 525 categories of birds. While the achieved accuracy may not be the highest priority, the primary goal is to gain hands-on experience and knowledge in the domain of deep learning.

**Project Structure**
- The project is organized into several key components, each serving a specific purpose in the image classification pipeline:

**Data Preparation (`data_prep.py`)**
- In the data_prep.py script, we address the crucial task of preparing the dataset for training. This involves collecting, organizing, and structuring the data in a suitable format for deep learning. The os library plays a significant role in efficiently managing files and directories.

**Data Loaders (`dataloader.py`)**
- To facilitate efficient data handling, the dataloader.py script focuses on creating data loaders using PyTorch's data handling capabilities. Data loaders are essential for loading and batching the dataset, making it ready for training and testing.

**Set Device to GPU(device.py)**
- This code snippet sets the device to GPU for model training, enabling faster computation and leveraging the power of the graphics card to accelerate deep learning processes.

**Model Architecture (`model_pytorch.py`)**
- Building the CNN model from scratch is a central component of this project. In model.py, we define the architecture of the custom CNN model. The model includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. It is designed to handle the complexity of classifying 525 different bird species.

**Training and Testing (`train_pytorch.py`)**
- The train.py script orchestrates the training and testing phases of the deep learning model. It leverages PyTorch's capabilities for defining loss functions, optimizing parameters, and monitoring training progress. Key aspects include GPU acceleration for faster training and evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy.

**Deep Learning Frameworks**
- Throughout the project, we explore and gain proficiency in two major deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow. This dual-framework approach broadens our understanding of deep learning ecosystems, enabling us to choose the right tool for future projects.
